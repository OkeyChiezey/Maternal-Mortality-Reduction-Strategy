Maternal Mortality Reduction Strategy: Data-Driven Precision Analysis for Nigeria

📌 Executive Summary

The Problem: Nigeria currently faces one of the most critical maternal mortality burdens globally, with significant geographic disparities where preventable pregnancy-related complications remain a leading cause of death.


The Solution: This project leverages a Data-Driven Strategy to move beyond broad interventions toward Precision Targeting. By analyzing 2020 mortality figures and healthcare indicators, we identify high-burden "hotspots" and key socio-economic drivers to inform UNICEF’s strategic resource allocation.

Next Steps: Implementation of a three-phased roadmap (0–36+ months) focusing on strengthening Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC), deploying Skilled Birth Attendants (SBAs), and integrating digital health monitoring systems.


Number Impact: * Targeting High-Risk States: Focus on states like Kebbi (1,077 MMR) and Sokoto (977 MMR) where mortality is nearly 7x higher than low-burden states like Abia (155 MMR).



Statistical Correlation: Identified a -0.96 inverse correlation between Antenatal Care (ANC) coverage and Maternal Mortality, proving that increasing ANC access is the single most effective lever for saving lives.



⚠️ The Problem Statement
Despite global advancements, many Nigerian women still die from preventable causes related to childbirth. The challenge is a "complex web" of:


Inadequate Healthcare Access: Over 52% of women report poor healthcare access.


Systemic Gaps: Low rates of facility-based deliveries (48.8%) and limited skilled birth attendance (53.4%).


Socio-Cultural Barriers: Trust issues with formal institutions and lack of decision-making autonomy at the household level.


🛠 Methodology
This analysis utilized a Multi-Variate Data Science Approach to identify actionable insights:


Descriptive Statistics: Audited mortality figures across 37 entries (36 states + FCT) to establish benchmarks.


Correlation Matrix Heat Mapping: Quantified the relationships between MMR, ANC coverage, and facility delivery rates to identify primary risk drivers.



Geographic Risk Profiling: Ranked states into priority tiers to enable "Precision Targeting" of UNICEF resources.



Strategic Planning: Developed a phased intervention timeline based on data-backed foundations.

🧰 Skills & Tech Stack

Languages: Python (Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical analysis).



Data Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn (Heatmaps, Scatter Plots, and Geographic Bar Charts).



Domain Expertise: Public Health Analytics, Strategic Resource Allocation, and M&E (Monitoring & Evaluation) Frameworks.



Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, SQL (Data Querying), and Geospatial Analysis.

📊 Results & Recommendations
Key Findings:

The ANC Lifeline: States with lower Antenatal Care attendance experience disproportionately higher maternal deaths.


Priority States: Katsina, Jigawa, Bauchi, Zamfara, and Kebbi are identified as the most immediate focus areas for intensified programming.

Strategic Recommendations:

Resource Allocation: Allocate a disproportionately higher share of funding and supplies (e.g., oxytocin, magnesium sulfate) to the top 5 high-burden states.



Infrastructure Upgrades: Rehabilitate Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) specifically in rural underserved areas.



Community Integration: Train and integrate Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) as referral agents rather than primary attendants to bridge cultural gaps.

🚀 Next Steps

Phase 1 (Foundations): Rapid assessments and emergency care strengthening in the top 3 highest-MMR states.



Phase 2 (Scaling): Deepening community mobilization and enhancing the quality of care through SBA recruitment.



Phase 3 (Sustainability): Integration of Digital Health Solutions for real-time data collection and operational research.




Policy Advocacy: Championing sustainable funding and the use of data for ongoing program refinement.
